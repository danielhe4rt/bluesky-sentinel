# BlueSky Sentinel

## Overview

BlueSky Sentinel is a Rust application designed to track events within the BlueSky
platform. It leverages ScyllaDB for database operations and implements a leveling system based on user activities such
as posts, likes, and reposts.

## Features

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d1aebe89-4300-4db2-ba23-c3fb21a3c066)

The main goal of the project is build a high-performance, scalable, and reliable application that can:

- Fetch and process public events from the BlueSky platform.
- Track user events and experiences.
- Implement a leveling system with experience points (XP).
- Display the connected Datacenters Network topology while interacting with it.

## Project Stack

The project uses the following technologies and packages:

- **Language:** [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
- **Database:** [ScyllaDB](https://www.scylladb.com/)
- **Packages:**
    - **ORM:** [charybdis](https://github.com/nodecosmos/charybdis)
    - **Jetstream Client:** [jetstream-oxide](https://github.com/videah/jetstream-oxide)
    - **Bluesky Client:** [atrium-api](https://github.com/sugyan/atrium)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/danielhe4rt/bluesky-sentinel.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd bluesky-jetstream-rpg
   ```
3. Clone the .env.example file and rename it to .env:
   ```sh
   cp .env.example .env
   ```  

4Build the project using Cargo:
   ```sh
   cargo build --release
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the application:
   ```sh
   cargo run --release
   ```

## Configuration

The project uses the following environment and configuration files:

- `src/main.rs`: Sets up the application environment and starts HTTP and Jetstream services.
- `src/jetstream.rs`: Configures and starts the Jetstream listener for specific events.
- `src/leveling.rs`: Defines the leveling system and calculates user levels based on experience points.

## Supported Events

The project tracks and processes the following event types:

- **Post:** app.bsky.feed.post
- **Like:** app.bsky.feed.like
- **Retweet:** app.bsky.feed.retweet

## Database Schema

The project uses ScyllaDB for database operations with the following table schemas:

| Type              | Name                           | Description                                   |
|-------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Table             | bsky_rpg.characters            | Stores user characters and leveling states.   |
| Table             | bsky_rpg.characters_experience | Stores user experience points using Counters. |
| Table             | bsky_rpg.events                | Stores user events.                           |
| Materialized View | bsky_rpg.events_by_type        | Materialized view of user events by type.     |
| UDT               | bsky_rpg.leveling              | User leveling schema type.                    |

    PRIMARY KEY (user_did, event_at)
) WITH CLUSTERING ORDER BY (event_at DESC);

-- Create Materialized View for Events by Type

  AND event_at IS NOT null
PRIMARY KEY ((user_did, event_type), event_at)
WITH CLUSTERING ORDER BY (event_at ASC);
